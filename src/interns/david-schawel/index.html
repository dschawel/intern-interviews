        <div class="about-bio">
            <p>I'm a passionate software engineer that loves write code that helps simplify processes and make a broad impact in the world.  In this internship, I'd like to expand my knowledge about how to efficiently optimize big data sets.  I thrive in a collaborative environment whether it be with other developers or across teams.  When I'm not behind my computer coding, I enjoy spending time with my rescue dog Jasper who is in the picture with me.</p>
